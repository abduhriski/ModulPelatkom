    "You work for a company that provides data services.  For \\\\$100/month, your company provides 15 gigabytes (GB) of data.  Then, any additional data is billed at \\\\$0.10/MB (or \\\\$100/GB, since 1,000 MB are in 1 GB).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the next code cell to write a function `get_phone_bill()` that takes as input:\n",
    "- `gb` = number of GB that the customer used in a month\n",
    "\n",
    "It should return the customer's total phone bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "- A customer who uses 10 GB of data in one month is billed only \\\\$100, since the usage stayed under 15 GB.  In other words, `get_phone_bill(10)` should return `100`.\n",
    "- A customer who uses 15.1 GB (or 15 GB + 100 MB) of data in one month has gone over by .1 GB, so they must pay \\\\$100 (cost of plan), plus \\\\$0.10 * 100 = \\\\$10, for a total bill of \\\\$110.  In other words, `get_phone_bill(15.1)` should return `110`.\n",
